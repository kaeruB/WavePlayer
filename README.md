The initial code was created in STM32 CubeMX. Most changes were made in "main.c" file and in "makefile".
The process of creating the aplication is described in "README.pdf" file attached to the project.

It can be easily extended to an MP3 player - Helix library is included and decoding is started but beacuse of the lack of time it wasn't possible to end the task.
